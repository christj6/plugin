
To compile a dll file for your D plugin,
go inside the main folder 

for example:
C:\Users\Jack\Documents\programming_stuff\dplug-master\examples\ms-encode
for the msencode plugin

"Shift + Right click" on some white space somewhere,
click "Open Powershell window here"

and when that window opens up, type in the following:

dub -b release-nobounds -f --combined

or

dub -b release-nobounds -f --combined -a x86_64 for a 64-bit plugin.
